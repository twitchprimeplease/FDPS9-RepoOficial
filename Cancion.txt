Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only

Two plus two is four
Minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block
Smoke trees (Ah)

You man were ducking (You man ducked)
Hold tight, Asznee (My brudda)

If she ain't on it, I ghost
Hah, look at your nose (Check your nose, fam)

Nose long like garden hose

The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"

Hop out the four-door with the .44
It was one, two, three and four (Us, man)
Chillin' in the corridor (Yo)
Your dad is forty-four (Uh)
And he's still callin' man for a draw (Look at him)
Let him know
When I see him
I'm gonna spin his jaw (Finished)
Take man's Twix by force (Take it)
Send man's shop by force (Send him)
